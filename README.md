# Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz 

This is a project for my Coding Bootcamp course. I was tasked to create a multiple choice code quiz within the parameters listed below: 

### User story: 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

### Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

## Challenges I faced 

- I had to reference JSON to use in my code, I was unfamiliar with JSON but I have improved! 
- Setting and clearing timer intervals
- Storing info to local storage , and retrieving info for my high scores page. I used multiple .js and .html pages.
